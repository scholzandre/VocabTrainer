Ideas: 
	- Translater with Deepl?
	- Text to speech?
	- intelligent learning mode -> based on last time wrong etc.
	- change color scheme in settings
	- fill LastTimeWrong when input is wrong
	- AnalysisView: list all words with properties "seen" OR "not seen" AND "last time wrong" AND "repeated"
	- more than three hints -> no repeated++
